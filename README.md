# Machine-Learning-Works
Hello Data Science Enthusiasts,
I hope you all are doing great.
I am excited to share a machine learning project I have been working on recently, focusing on predicting customer churn.
I have developed a customer churn prediction model using a dataset, leveraging machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and random forest. 
The goal of this project is to proactively identify the methods to reduce customer attrition and improve retention strategies.
If you are interested in exploring the project further, you can find it on my GitHub repository.
Thank you for taking the time to learn about the project. I hope you find it helpful. Please let me know if you have any suggestions to make it better.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
