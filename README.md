# Machine-Learning-Works
Hello Data Science Enthusiasts,
I hope you all are doing great. I wanted to share some exciting machine learning projects I have been working on recently.
I have developed machine learning projects centered around customers. 
These projects are made using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and random forest for customer churn prediction model.
And clustering algorithms for segmentation and collaborative filtering for recommendations. 
If you are interested in exploring these projects further, you can find them on my GitHub repository.
Thank you for taking the time to learn about my projects. I hope you find them helpful. Please let me know if you have any suggestion to make them better.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
